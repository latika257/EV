When starting the analysis, the first step after collecting the data is cleaning it. Cleaning a large dataset might take some time and become boring, but it's worth it when you find insights from it. It feels like achieving something.

So, here's another Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) performed by me on an electric vehicle dataset.

Let's deep dive into the dataset. It comprises car, charging, year_sale, group, and register datasets, which provide us with insights into EVs in a broad sense.

Now, some insights from this analysis:
*In which state did how many males and females buy EVs?
*In which state are charging facilities more prevalent?
*Which brand is preferred for EV purchases?
*What body type do people prefer when buying EVs?
*How many seats do people prefer?
*Which brand and seating capacity are popular choices for EV buyers?
*What type of charging is mostly used, and many more.
